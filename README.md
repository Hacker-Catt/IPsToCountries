# Why use this? 
Excel is a pain in the ***; just use a simple python script to save yourself a lot of time and headaches. 1.7M rows in the output file, excel won't like that anyway :)

# Step 1 
Python only, install Pandas

# Step 2
Make sure you download the new Input files from IPLocate and store them in the same folder as the script

# Step 3 
Run the script and enjoy your friendly format IPLocations. Perfect to add to SIEM solutions
